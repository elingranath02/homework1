Homework 1

The 8 queens problem was firstly solved sequentially. The code included one recursive method and a scan method that checked if
the queen placements were valid. The recursive method considered all possible combinations of queen placements by going from the
top to the bottom. This meant that the diagonal and vertical scans only included the rows above the considered queen placement.
Later, the algorithm was parallelized by adding multiple threads. A pipeline was created with several worker threads. 
One main thread was placing the queens and the others checked if the placement was correct. One thread controlled
the upper left diagonal, another the upper right diagonal and one thread checked vertically above the possible queen placement.
When timing the execution, the runtime did not improve and was instead increased by a lot. Another more effective way 
of parallelizing the code was to have one working thread per column in the board.
Since the threads could run independently and in parallel if they had their own boards, one thread could generate all of the results when
the first queen was placed on "a1" and another thread could generate the results when the first queen was placed on "b1" and so on.
This resulted in the need of using mutexes for locking both the variable keeping track of the number of solutions,
and the method for printing the board. When using 8 different threads, the execution time was much better than the
first parallelized code but had not improved from the sequential code. The second program was around 200x faster than the first
parallelized program but half as fast as the sequential code.
